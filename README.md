## Tools used

- **NETStandar.Library** - A set of standard .NET APIs that are prescribed to be used and supported together.
<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/>

- **Prism.Unity.Forms** - Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF, Xamarin Forms, Uno Platform and WinUI. Separate releases are available for each platform and those will be developed on independent timelines. Prism provides an implementation of a collection of design patterns that are helpful in writing well-structured and maintainable XAML applications, including MVVM, dependency injection, commands, EventAggregator, and others. Prism's core functionality is a shared code base supported in .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.5 / 4.7. Those things that need to be platform specific are implemented in the respective libraries for the target platform. Prism also provides great integration of these patterns with the target platform. For example, Prism for Xamarin Forms allows you to use an abstraction for navigation that is unit testable, but that layers on top of the platform concepts and APIs for navigation so that you can fully leverage what the platform itself has to offer, but done in the MVVM way.

- **PropertyChanged.Fody** - Add property notification to all classes that implement INotifyPropertyChanged.

- **System.Text.Json** - Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that serialize objects to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text and deserialize JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. Also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM), that is read-only, for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp* System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer
